	<h1>Use Case</h1>
	<p>
		Steve has been very productive the past couple of days and feels like he has been making the best graphics lately. One day he finishes his current project but doesnâ€™t know what to make next, he goes through inspiration grid first through the art page, after he goes through the design page. He sees a minimalistic post that he likes a lot and decides to make his own version of it in illustrator. Steve at the beginning felt uninspired and bored of his previous work and after scrolling through inspiration grid he had a new interest and explores it.
