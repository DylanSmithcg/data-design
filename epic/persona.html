		Steve is a 26 year old man who lives in Durango, CO he has a fulltime job as a professor at Fort Lewis college.
		Steve has a wife and they are both artists, she likes to paint while Steve in his downtime likes to make graphics
		in photoshop and illustrator on his computer. He likes to print them and hang them up in his house or sell them locally to
		people or create graphics at their request. Making graphics on his computer is a hobby he has had for years and he is quite
		invested in it, he has a high specs PC and multiple monitors and will spend hours behind a screen. Steve is really
		creative and makes very intricate pieces, and from time to time he likes to post his art on websites and social
		media. He posts on sites like reddit, and on his Instagram page through his phone. From time to time like all
		artists, Steve encounters a drought of creativity every once and awhile and looks for inspiration and cant work
		on anything until he comes up with something. He will look up art pages on Instagram and look through subreddits,
		his favorite website during this time is inspiration grid where he can see other people’s graphics and art. He
		eventually feels inspired once he sees someone else’s work and he learns how they created it. He likes inspiration
		grid for its variety of content and its easy to use look. Steve prefers the minimalistic design of the pages but
		thinks it could function and transition a little smoother. He likes when viewing art it recommends more at the
		bottom but feels that it should automatically transition into another post, that way it gives a continuous
		scrolling feeling. This way he can scroll through a lot of content faster and continuously.
