	<p><strong>Description:</strong>Steve is 26 years old man and he lives in Durango, CO he has a fulltime job as a professor at Fort Lewis college. Steve has a wife and they are both artists, she likes to paint while Steve in his downtime likes to make graphics in photoshop and illustrator on his computer. He likes to print them and hang them up in his house or sell them to people as art or at their request. Making graphics on his computer is a hobby he has had for years and he is quite invested in it, he has a high specs PC and multiple monitors and will spend hours behind a screen. Steve is really creative and makes very intricate pieces, and from time to time he likes to post his art on websites and social media. He posts on sites like reddit, and on his Instagram page through his phone. Like all artists Steve will eventually encounter a drought of creativity every once and awhile and looks for inspiration and can’t work on anything until he comes up with something. He will look up art pages on Instagram and look through subreddits, his favorite website during this time is inspiration grid where he can see other people’s graphics and art. He eventually feels inspired once he sees someone else’s work and learns how they made it. He likes inspiration grid for its variety of content and its easy to use look. Steve prefers the minimalistic design of the pages but thinks it could function and transition a little smoother. He enjoys when viewing a piece or series it will recommend more at the bottom but feels that it should automatically transition into another post, that way it gives a continuous scrolling feeling. This way he can scroll through a lot of content faster and continuously. </p>
